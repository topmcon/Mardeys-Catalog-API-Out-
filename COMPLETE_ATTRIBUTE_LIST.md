1. **width** - Product width
2. **length** - Product length
3. **height** - Product height
4. **diameter** - Product diameter (when applicable)
5. **depth** - Product depth

---

These are nested within the `feature_groups` array. Each feature group has:

1. **name** - Feature group category name (e.g., "Installation", "Features", "Performance")
2. **features** - Array of feature strings

Feature groups typically organize product features into logical categories for display.

---

## PRICE RANGE ATTRIBUTES (3)

These are nested within the `price_range` object and appear in 100% of products:

1. **min** - Minimum price
2. **max** - Maximum price
3. **has_range** - Boolean indicating if there's a price range

---

## Data Structure Notes

1. **Nested Objects**: `specifications`, `dimensions`, `price_range` are always objects
2. **Arrays**: `feature_groups`, `resources`, `related_categories`, `recommended_options`, `categories` are arrays
3. **Null Values**: Many fields can be null (especially in lighting products: warranty, variant_count, rating, etc.)
4. **Specification Variance**: The 409 specification attributes vary greatly by category - most products only have 20-50 of these
5. **Feature Groups**: These provide organized, human-readable feature lists perfect for "Features" tabs
